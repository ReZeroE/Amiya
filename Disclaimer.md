# Disclaimer of Liability

The Amiya package is provided "as is", and the author(s) and contributor(s) make no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the safety, suitability, inaccuracies, typographical errors, or other harmful components of this software. There are inherent dangers in the use of any software, and you are solely responsible for determining whether this Amiya package is compatible with your equipment and other software installed on your equipment.

The Amiya package is designed to interact with applications solely through their existing interfaces and controls. It does not modify, alter, or change any application files. The automation is achieved by utilizing the interface elements that are already implemented by the application, ensuring that the Amiya package operates in a non-intrusive manner with respect to the application's files and internal configurations.


### Safety

While the Amiya package has implemented robust safety features to reduce the risk of unintended operation, users must understand that it operates completely locally and automates applications by recording and replaying user's keystrokes, mouse clicks, and movements. Please be aware that although the package has been thoroughly tested, the package automates actions based on your own predefined sequences, and the outcome of running such scripts is dependent on those initial conditions set by you, the user.


### Compliance of Application Guidelines

By using the Amiya package, you acknowledge that you are aware of and will adhere to any guidelines, terms, and conditions of the applications you automate using this package. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in violations which are solely your responsibility. Ensure that the use of this package does not contravene any rules or agreements applicable to the software or environments it is used with.


### Privacy

By using the Amiya package, you acknowledge that all actions performed during a recording session are **stored locally** and can be replayed with or without modifications. The Amiya package runs offline and does not establish any internet connections.
